Implement Phase 2: Use OurLads depth charts as the “starter/backups authority” to generate the indexed player list, while still using Sleeper players.json for IDs/slugs and player metadata.

Existing:
- We already have cached Sleeper players in wp-content/uploads/statchasers/players.json
- We have container page rendering working for /nfl/players/ and /nfl/players/{slug}/
- We have sitemap-players.xml and directory page.

Goal:
Generate an accurate index set of players based on OurLads depth charts for EACH TEAM:
- QB1/QB2
- RB1/RB2
- WR1/WR2/WR3
- TE1/TE2
- K1
- DEF

Create files:
- wp-content/uploads/statchasers/indexed_players.json
- wp-content/uploads/statchasers/indexed_players_by_team.json

Implementation details:

1) Add a fetcher module: includes/depthcharts-ourlads.php
- Fetch the OurLads depth chart source once (daily) and store raw HTML in:
  wp-content/uploads/statchasers/ourlads_depthcharts.html (or JSON if easier)
- Do NOT fetch on every page request.
- Add WP-Cron daily job to refresh.
- Add admin button: “Refresh OurLads Depth Charts Now”

2) Parser:
- Parse the OurLads depth chart content to extract per team:
  QB1,QB2; RB1,RB2; WR1,WR2,WR3; TE1,TE2; K1; DEF
- Output a normalized structure:
  {
    "MIA": {
      "QB": ["Tua Tagovailoa","Mike White"],
      "RB": ["Raheem Mostert","De'Von Achane"],
      "WR": ["Tyreek Hill","Jaylen Waddle","..."],
      "TE": ["...","..."],
      "K": ["..."],
      "DEF": ["MIA"]
    },
    ...
  }

3) Mapping OurLads names -> Sleeper player entries:
- Load cached Sleeper players.json.
- Build a lookup keyed by:
  normalized_name + team + position
- Normalization function must:
  - lowercase
  - remove punctuation
  - collapse whitespace
  - handle suffixes: jr, sr, ii, iii
  - handle apostrophes/hyphens (e.g., De'Von)
- Matching rules:
  a) Exact match on normalized full_name + team + position
  b) If not found, try matching by last_name + first initial + team + position
  c) If still not found, allow team match + last_name match for that position
- Collect unmatched names in an “unmatched” array per team and show it in admin UI.

4) Generate indexed player outputs based on the mapped Sleeper players:
- For each team, add slugs for the mapped players:
  QB(2), RB(2), WR(3), TE(2), K(1), DEF(1)
- Save:
  indexed_players_by_team.json with full detail including:
    name, slug, id, team, position, source_name, match_confidence
- Save:
  indexed_players.json with:
  {
    "generated_at": "...",
    "source": "ourlads",
    "counts": {...},
    "slugs": [...]
  }

5) Integrate outputs:
- Update sitemap-players.xml to only include slugs from indexed_players.json.
- Update /nfl/players/ directory page to:
  - default view = indexed players (grouped by team + position)
  - search can optionally search ALL cached Sleeper players.

6) Admin UI:
Under Tools -> StatChasers Players add:
- Refresh Sleeper Player Cache button (existing)
- Refresh OurLads Depth Charts button
- Generate Indexed Player List button (Phase 2)
- Show:
  - last refresh time for Sleeper cache
  - last refresh time for OurLads
  - count totals
  - unmatched names table (OurLads name that couldn’t map)

Important:
- No front-end requests to OurLads.
- Everything is cached and generated via admin action / cron.
- Keep CSS scoped to .sc-players only.
