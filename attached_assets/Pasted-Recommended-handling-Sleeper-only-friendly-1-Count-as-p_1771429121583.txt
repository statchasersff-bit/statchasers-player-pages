Recommended handling (Sleeper-only friendly)
1) Count as “played” if any of these are true

For that week’s stat object, if any stat is present and > 0:

WR/TE

targets (rec_tgt or targets) > 0

receptions (rec) > 0

receiving yards (rec_yd) ≠ 0

receiving TD (rec_td) > 0

rushing attempts (rush_att) > 0 (end-arounds)

RB

rush_att > 0 OR rec_tgt/targets > 0 OR rec > 0

QB

pass_att > 0 OR rush_att > 0 OR sacks > 0

This correctly counts “left in 1st quarter after 1 target” as played.

What if they got injured before recording a stat?

If they truly recorded no stats (no targets, no carries, no pass attempts), Sleeper often won’t give a meaningful row anyway. In that case, you can’t reliably know they played from Sleeper alone.

So:

If there is no stat row → treat as DNP / No Data

If there is a stat row but everything is 0/null → treat as DNP (unless you add a different source later)

This is the most honest approach with Sleeper constraints.

2) Do we include “injury games” in PPG / volatility / bust?

✅ Yes, if they “played” by the rule above.

That’s how fantasy works.

Otherwise you create inflated stats and people won’t trust the platform.

3) But we can add a fairness improvement: “Full Games” vs “All Games”

If you want to be extra premium:

Show two PPGs (optional):

PPG (All Games) — includes injury exits

PPG (Full Games) — excludes games where opportunities were extremely low

But with Sleeper-only data, you need a heuristic.

4) Heuristic to flag “partial games” (no snap data required)
For WR/TE (simple rule)

Flag as “partial” if:

targets ≤ 1 AND fantasy points < 3

For RB

touches (rush_att + targets) ≤ 3 AND fantasy points < 3

For QB

pass_att ≤ 10 AND fantasy points < 8

This isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough and explainable.

Then you can:

keep your main metrics using All Games

optionally show a small tooltip:
“Includes 1 partial game”

Premium + transparent.

5) Weekly finish calculation with injury games

✅ Keep them included.

If a WR gets injured and scores 1.2 points, that should rank like WR78 for the week — that’s reality.

Just make sure your ranking pool is still “players who played,” not all active rostered WRs.

Copy/paste for Replit AI
Handle in-game injuries fairly in “games played” logic.

Rule:
- A week counts as played if the player recorded any participation stats.
  WR/TE: targets(rec_tgt/targets)>0 OR rec>0 OR rec_yd!=0 OR rush_att>0
  RB: rush_att>0 OR targets>0 OR rec>0
  QB: pass_att>0 OR rush_att>0 OR sacks>0
- Include 0-point games IF the player had participation (e.g., 1 target, 0 catches).
- If no weekly stat record exists, treat as DNP/no data (we cannot infer participation from Sleeper alone).

Optional premium:
- Flag “partial games” with heuristics (very low opportunities + low points) and show a tooltip count, but do not exclude them from core metrics by default.


If you tell me which exact stat keys your Sleeper weekly objects contain (e.g., rec_tgt vs targets), I’ll tailor the played/partial rules to your real payload so it’s plug-and-play.
