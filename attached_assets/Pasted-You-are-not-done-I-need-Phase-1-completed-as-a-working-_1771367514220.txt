You are not done. I need Phase 1 completed as a working, production-ready baseline.

ASSUME:
- We already have player-profile.tsx and some APIs wired.
- The problem is: pages are shells, not fully populated, not linked, and not SEO-ready.
- Your job is to IMPLEMENT the missing pieces and verify end-to-end functionality.

DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS. Inspect the repo and make the changes below.

PHASE 1 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must all pass):

A) DATA CONTRACT (single source of truth)
1. Create a single normalized Player DTO returned by GET /api/players/:slug:
   {
     slug, fullName, teamAbbr, position,
     age, heightIn, weightLb, status,
     headshotUrl,
     lastUpdated,
     season, // current season year
     trends: { weeklyFantasyPoints: number[] } | null,
     gameLog: Array<{ week, opp, result, fantasyPts, detailsUrl? }>,
     news: Array<{ title, source, publishedAt, url, summary? }>
   }
2. Update player-profile.tsx to ONLY depend on this DTO (no reading local JSON directly in the component).
3. If any section has no data, show a premium empty state (not raw text).

B) REAL PLAYER DATA (not placeholder)
1. For Snapshot: ensure age/height/weight/status/team/position always render.
2. If Sleeper data is missing height/weight, add fallback mapping or allow null and show “—”.
3. Headshot:
   - If there is no headshotUrl, render a default silhouette image from /public.

C) GAME LOG (wired for current season)
1. /api/players/:slug must return gameLog as an array (can be empty).
2. Game log UI must show:
   - Table headers always
   - If empty: show designed empty state with icon + copy
3. Add “Details” column with a disabled button if detailsUrl is missing.

D) ARTICLES & NEWS (wired and future-proof)
1. Implement /api/players/:slug/news returning an array (can be empty).
2. UI should support list items with title/source/date and link.
3. If empty: show premium empty state.

E) TRENDS SECTION (chart-ready)
1. Trends must have a chart container and accept weeklyFantasyPoints[] when available.
2. If trends is null/empty: show premium placeholder state.
3. Add TODO for Phase 2 to populate weeklyFantasyPoints.

F) INTERNAL LINKING + DISCOVERABILITY (THIS IS THE BIG ONE)
1. Create a new index page:
   - /nfl/players/ (players index)
   - Shows a searchable/sortable table of players (name, team, pos, status)
   - Each row links to /nfl/players/:slug/
2. Ensure there is NO 404 for /nfl/players/ and /nfl/players/:slug/
3. Add a sitemap endpoint or generation step:
   - /sitemap.xml must include /nfl/players/ and all player slugs
4. Add internal links on:
   - homepage or navbar -> Players
   - player page -> “Back to Players” link

G) SEO BASICS
1. Player pages must set:
   - <title> like “Josh Allen Fantasy Football Outlook | StatChasers”
   - meta description
   - canonical URL
2. Add JSON-LD schema (Person or SportsPerson) for player pages.

DELIVERABLES (show me results)
1. List files changed with brief explanation.
2. Provide the exact URLs to test locally.
3. Confirm /nfl/players/ is NOT 404 and lists at least 20 seeded players.
4. Confirm /nfl/players/josh-allen/ shows real snapshot data and all sections render.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do not use paid APIs.
- Do not scrape.
- Use existing Sleeper data and/or local JSON cache, but expose it through the DTO.
- Keep styling consistent with StatChasers premium look, light + dark modes.

Now implement.
