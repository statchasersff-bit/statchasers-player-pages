Implement Step 4: Dynamic player profile pages like FantasyPros.

Context:
- This is a Vite + Express app.
- We already generate data/players.json from Sleeper via scripts/buildPlayersIndex.js.
- We have an Express endpoint GET /api/players returning a lightweight list:
  { id, name, slug, team, position }.

Goal:
When a user visits /nfl/players/tyreek-hill it should render a full player profile page (Tyreek-style layout) using the existing app header/footer (no separate site layout).

Requirements:

A) Server API improvement (recommended):
1) Add a new endpoint:
   GET /api/players/:slug
   - It should load from data/players.json (cached in memory).
   - Find the player by slug.
   - If found, return full player object fields:
     id, name, slug, position, team, status, injury_status, age, height, weight
   - If not found, return 404 JSON { error: "not_found" }.
   - Add Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600.

B) Client route:
2) Add a client route:
   /nfl/players/:slug
   pointing to a new page component (e.g. PlayerProfilePage.tsx).

C) Player profile page UI:
3) On page mount, read slug from the router params and fetch:
   GET /api/players/:slug

4) Render a premium StatChasers-style player profile page layout similar to FantasyPros:
   - Top section: Player name (H1), position-team line, status/injury badge.
   - “Player Snapshot” card with:
     Team, Position, Age, Height, Weight, Status, Injury Status
   - Add placeholder sections (for now):
     - “Trends” (placeholder copy: coming soon)
     - “Game Log” (placeholder table header)
     - “Articles / News” (placeholder)
     - “Rankings / Projections” (placeholder)
   - Add internal links back to:
     /nfl/players (directory)
     /rankings
     /tools
     /articles

5) Loading and errors:
   - While loading, show a skeleton or “Loading player…”
   - If 404, show “Player not found” and link back to /nfl/players

D) SEO:
6) Update the document title dynamically on the client:
   "{Player Name} Fantasy Football Profile | StatChasers"
   (If there’s an existing SEO/head utility in the project, use it.)

E) Styling:
7) Use the site’s existing UI system and Tailwind classes if Tailwind is already configured.
   Do NOT create a new navbar/header/footer—must feel like the same website.

After implementing, tell me:
- Which server files you edited to add GET /api/players/:slug
- Which client route file you edited to add /nfl/players/:slug
- The new component file path for PlayerProfilePage
- How to test with a known slug like /nfl/players/tyreek-hill
