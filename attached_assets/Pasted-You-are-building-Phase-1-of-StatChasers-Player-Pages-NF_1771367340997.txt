You are building Phase 1 of StatChasers “Player Pages” (NFL). Goal: take existing player page shells and actually fill them with real data.

TECH STACK
- Node.js + Express backend
- Server-side rendered HTML using EJS (or a simple template function) OR React static page served by Express (pick the simplest path; prioritize speed and SEO).
- Use SQLite (or Postgres if already configured) to store player metadata + cached stats.
- Frontend should be premium and match StatChasers styling (light + dark mode support).

ROUTES
- Player page route: /nfl/players/:slug/
- Example: /nfl/players/josh-allen/

PHASE 1 REQUIREMENTS (must complete all)
1) Player Snapshot Card (top)
   - Fields: full_name, team_abbr, position, age, height_in, weight_lb, status
   - Also show headshot image (fallback silhouette if missing)

2) Trends section
   - For now: show a chart-ready container + “Coming soon” placeholder, but wire the data contract so it can accept weekly fantasy points later.
   - Put TODOs in code for later phases.

3) Game Log section
   - Create table with columns: Week, Opp, Result, Fantasy Pts, Details (link/button)
   - If no season data exists, show a clean empty state (not ugly text)

4) Articles & News section
   - Create table/list UI that can accept data later.
   - For now: show empty state.
   - Add a backend placeholder endpoint that returns [] so the frontend is wired.

DATA
- Create database schema:
  Table players:
    id, slug, full_name, team_abbr, position, age, height_in, weight_lb, status, headshot_url, updated_at
  Table game_logs:
    id, player_id, season, week, opp, result, fantasy_pts, details_json, created_at

- Seed at least 1 player (Josh Allen) into players table so the page renders real values.
- Create a simple slug generator.

BACKEND LOGIC
- GET /api/players/:slug -> returns player JSON
- GET /api/players/:slug/game-log?season=2025 -> returns game log rows (can be empty)
- GET /api/players/:slug/news -> returns [] for now

PAGE RENDERING
- Server should render the player page using backend data (SEO-friendly).
- The player page must fetch from DB (not hardcoded) and gracefully handle missing/empty data.

UI
- Implement premium card UI:
  - Rounded corners, soft shadow, thin border
  - Light/dark mode
  - Section headers with subtle icon + divider
  - Empty states should look designed (icon + short copy)
- Keep CSS in a single file: /public/player.css
- Ensure layout looks good at 1180px max width and is responsive.

DELIVERABLES
- Working route /nfl/players/josh-allen/ showing real snapshot data from DB
- Backend APIs returning JSON (even if empty)
- Clean UI for Snapshot, Trends placeholder, Game Log (empty), News (empty)
- Clear TODO comments for Phase 2 (stats/trends/news ingestion)

IMPORTANT
- Do not rely on paid APIs.
- Do not scrape.
- Use mock/seed data in DB for now.
- Write code cleanly, with folder structure:
  /server.js
  /db.js
  /views/player.ejs (or equivalent)
  /public/player.css
  /seed.js
