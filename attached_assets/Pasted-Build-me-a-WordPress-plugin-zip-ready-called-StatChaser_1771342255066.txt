Build me a WordPress plugin (zip-ready) called "StatChasers Player Pages" that creates SEO-friendly programmatic NFL player pages inside my existing WordPress/Divi site.

Target URLs:
1) /nfl/players/                 -> directory/search page
2) /nfl/players/{slug}/          -> player profile page (example: /nfl/players/tyreek-hill/)

Critical requirement:
These pages MUST use my existing WordPress theme header/footer (Divi). Do NOT output a separate navbar/header/footer. Templates must call get_header() and get_footer().

Data source:
Use Sleeper Players API ONLY to build the player index (cached):
GET https://api.sleeper.app/v1/players/nfl

Caching requirements (very important):
- Do NOT call Sleeper on every page load.
- Store a trimmed players array as a JSON file in wp-content/uploads/statchasers/players.json.
- Provide an admin page under Tools -> StatChasers Players with:
  - "Refresh Player Index" button
  - shows last refresh time + number of players
- Also schedule WP-Cron to refresh daily.
- Filter positions: QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF
- Slugify full_name: lowercase, remove punctuation, spaces -> hyphens
- Save fields: id, name, slug, position, team (default FA), status, injury_status, age, height, weight.

Routing requirements:
- Add rewrite rules:
  - ^nfl/players/?$ => index page
  - ^nfl/players/([^/]+)/?$ => player slug page
- Register query vars:
  - sc_players_index
  - sc_player_slug
- On template_redirect, load plugin templates:
  - templates/index.php for directory
  - templates/player.php for player page
- Return proper 404 if slug not found.

Directory/search page behavior (/nfl/players/):
- Show a search input and results list similar to FantasyPros.
- For performance: do NOT print all 4000+ players in HTML.
- Create a REST endpoint:
  GET /wp-json/statchasers/v1/players?q=
  which returns top 20 matches (id,name,slug,team,position) based on query parameter q.
- The directory page uses JS fetch to that endpoint and renders results.
- Clicking a result navigates to /nfl/players/{slug}/

Player page behavior (/nfl/players/{slug}/):
- Render an H1: player name
- Show position — team line
- Show status/injury badge if present
- Render a "Player Snapshot" section listing age/height/weight/status/injury
- Add placeholder sections: Trends, Game Log, Rankings/Projections, News (coming soon)
- Add internal links back to /nfl/players, /rankings, /tools, /articles

SEO requirements:
- Hook wp_head to output dynamic:
  - <title>{Player Name} Fantasy Football Profile | StatChasers</title> (only on player pages)
  - <meta name="description" content="Fantasy profile for {Player Name} ({POS} - {TEAM}). Stats, trends, and StatChasers insights.">
  - <link rel="canonical" href="https://statchasers.com/nfl/players/{slug}/">
- Add JSON-LD SportsPerson structured data.
- Add a player sitemap endpoint:
  GET /sitemap-players.xml
  that outputs a valid XML sitemap of the first 300 player URLs on statchasers.com.

Deliverables:
- Full plugin folder structure:
  statchasers-player-pages/
    statchasers-player-pages.php
    includes/
      admin-page.php
      cache.php
      rewrite.php
      rest.php
      sitemap.php
      seo.php
    templates/
      index.php
      player.php
    assets/
      players.js
- Provide simple install steps: zip plugin folder, upload to WP, activate, flush permalinks.
