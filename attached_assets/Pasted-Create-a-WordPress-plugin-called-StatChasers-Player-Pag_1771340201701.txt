Create a WordPress plugin called "StatChasers Player Pages" that adds programmatic SEO-friendly NFL player pages on my existing WordPress/Divi site.

Goal URLs:
- /nfl/players/               (index/search page)
- /nfl/players/{slug}/        (player page, e.g. /nfl/players/malik-willis/)

Critical requirement:
These pages MUST use my existing site header/footer (Divi theme). So the template must call get_header() and get_footer() and should not render its own navbar.

Data source:
Use Sleeper Players API:
GET https://api.sleeper.app/v1/players/nfl

Architecture requirements:

1) Rewrite rules + routing:
- Add rewrite rule for player slug: ^nfl/players/([^/]+)/?$
- Add rewrite rule for index: ^nfl/players/?$
- Register query vars (sc_player_slug, sc_player_index)
- On template redirect, if sc_player_slug exists, load a custom PHP template from the plugin.
- If sc_player_index exists, load a custom PHP template from the plugin.

2) Caching the Sleeper player dataset:
- Do NOT fetch the Sleeper API on every page load.
- Create a caching layer that stores a trimmed players array in WP options or a JSON file inside wp-content/uploads/statchasers/players.json.
- Provide a WP-Admin tool page under Tools > StatChasers Players with:
  - "Refresh Player Index" button (manual refresh)
  - display last refresh time and total players.
- Also schedule a WP Cron job to refresh daily.

Trimmed player fields to store:
- id (player_id)
- name (full_name or first+last)
- slug (lowercase, hyphens, remove punctuation)
- position
- team (or FA)
- status
- injury_status
- age
- height
- weight

Filter to positions: QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF.

3) Player page template output (SEO-first):
- Output an H1 with player name
- Output a subtitle line with position and team
- Output a "Player Snapshot" section listing age/height/weight/status/injury_status
- Add internal links back to /rankings/ /tools/ /articles/
- Return 404 if player slug not found.

4) SEO metadata:
- Hook into wp_head to output dynamic <title> and meta description for player pages:
  Title: "{Player Name} Fantasy Football Profile | StatChasers"
  Description: "Fantasy profile for {Player Name} ({POS} - {TEAM}). Stats, trends, and StatChasers insights."
- Add canonical URL tag pointing to /nfl/players/{slug}/
- Add basic JSON-LD structured data for a SportsPerson with name, team, and sport (football).

5) Index/Search page:
- Create a clean search UI inside the WordPress template (not a separate app):
  - A search input that filters players client-side (load players list as JSON from a plugin endpoint).
  - Results link to /nfl/players/{slug}/
- Keep styling minimal and let the theme handle typography.

6) Provide a custom endpoint for sitemap:
- Add a route like /wp-json/statchasers/v1/player-sitemap that returns a list of the first 300 player URLs.
- Also give instructions for how I can submit these URLs to Google (Search Console), and optionally how to add them to my sitemap plugin if possible.

Deliverables:
- Full plugin folder with main PHP file
- templates/player.php and templates/index.php
- admin page and cron refresh code
- REST endpoints for players JSON and sitemap list
- installation instructions (zip plugin, upload, activate, flush permalinks)
