SECTION 1 — Opportunity Momentum
🔹 Purpose

Instantly show:

Is usage expanding or shrinking?

Is the role stable?

Is production sustainable?

🧠 Layout Structure
Top Row — Role Momentum Snapshot (Delta-Based)
Metric	Season	Last 4	Δ
Target Share	18.2%	24.6%	+6.4%
Targets / Game	6.3	8.1	+1.8
Snap %	74%	86%	+12%
TD Rate	5.1%	9.3%	+4.2%

Important: These are comparative deltas, not averages.
This avoids duplicating Overview.

🎯 Primary Badge (Large, Visual)

Under the table:

🟢 ROLE EXPANDING

or
🟡 ROLE STABLE
or
🔴 ROLE DECLINING

📊 Core Metrics (Sleeper-Native)

You can compute all of these right now:

1️⃣ Target Share %
Target Share = Player Targets / Team Pass Attempts


(Team pass attempts from matchup data)

2️⃣ Targets per Game Delta
Last 4 T/G - Season T/G

3️⃣ Snap % Delta (if available)

If snap % unavailable for some games:
Use rolling average of available weeks only.

4️⃣ TD Dependency Index
TD Points / Total Fantasy Points


If:

35% = High TD reliance

20–35% = Balanced

<20% = Volume-backed

Display small tag:
⚠️ TD-Driven Production
or
📈 Volume-Backed Production

🔥 Add Proprietary Score (StatChasers Differentiator)
Role Momentum Score (0–100)

Formula example:

Momentum =
  (Target Share Delta × 4)
+ (Targets/Game Delta × 3)
+ (Snap% Delta × 2)
+ (Recent TD Delta × 1)

Normalize to 0–100 scale


Display:

Role Momentum: 78 / 100

🟢 Strong Upward Trend

🧊 Add Stability Layer (Small Card on Right)
Usage Stability Score (0–100)

Based on:

Std deviation of targets

Weekly share variance

Example:

Stable Role (84/100)
or
Volatile Usage (52/100)

This complements Momentum.

Momentum = Direction
Stability = Predictability

🎨 Visual Hierarchy (Premium Feel)

Section 1 should look like:

| ROLE MOMENTUM: 78 / 100 🟢 EXPANDING |

Target Share Δ +6.4%
Targets/Game Δ +1.8
Snap % Δ +12%
TD Rate Δ +4.2%

Production Type: Volume-Backed
Usage Stability: 84 / 100

Clean. Focused. No fluff.

🚀 Why This Works

It:

Doesn’t replicate Overview

Doesn’t replicate Game Log

Uses only Sleeper-available data

Feels analytical

Feels proprietary

Feels premium
