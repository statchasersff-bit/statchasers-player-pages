Implement Step 5: SEO support for the player directory and player pages in my Vite + Express app.

Context:
- Client routes:
  /nfl/players
  /nfl/players/:slug
- Express endpoints already exist or will exist:
  GET /api/players
  GET /api/players/:slug
- Player data ultimately comes from data/players.json (generated from Sleeper).

Goal:
Make these pages discoverable like FantasyPros by generating correct meta tags per player and providing a sitemap of player URLs.

Requirements:

A) Dynamic Meta Tags on Player Page
1) On the client PlayerProfilePage (/nfl/players/:slug), set:
   document.title = "{Player Name} Fantasy Football Profile | StatChasers"
2) Also set/update meta tags at runtime:
   - <meta name="description" content="Fantasy profile for {Player Name} ({POS} - {TEAM}). Stats, trends, and StatChasers insights.">
   - <link rel="canonical" href="https://statchasers.com/nfl/players/{slug}/">
3) If these tags already exist, update them; if not, create them.
4) Add a JSON-LD script tag to the head (SportsPerson) with fields:
   name, sport ("American Football"), and affiliation/team if available.

B) Player Sitemap Endpoint (Server)
5) Add an Express endpoint:
   GET /sitemap-players.xml
   - Reads from data/players.json (cached in memory).
   - Outputs a valid XML sitemap with the first 300 player URLs:
     https://statchasers.com/nfl/players/{slug}/
   - Use content-type: application/xml
   - Include <lastmod> as the file modified date or current date.
6) Add Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600.

C) Robots.txt Endpoint (Server)
7) Add an Express endpoint:
   GET /robots.txt
   - Returns:
     User-agent: *
     Allow: /
     Sitemap: https://statchasers.com/sitemap-players.xml
   - content-type: text/plain

D) Testing instructions
8) After implementing, tell me which server file(s) were edited and provide test URLs:
   - /sitemap-players.xml
   - /robots.txt

Important:
- Do NOT fetch the Sleeper API inside these endpoints.
- Use the local cached players data from data/players.json.
