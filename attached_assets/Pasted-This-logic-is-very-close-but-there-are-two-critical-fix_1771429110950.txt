This logic is very close, but there are two critical fixes you should make so the metrics don’t lie:

Games Played should not be “pts_ppr > 0”

Your Consistency score formula is too punitive and collapses to 0 too often

Here’s the optimized, StatChasers-grade version.

1) Games Played: don’t filter by pts_ppr > 0
Why it’s wrong

A player can play and score 0.0 (goose egg) — that’s exactly the kind of game that should count for:

PPG

Bust %

Volatility

Starter/Elite %

Filtering out 0-point games artificially:

boosts PPG

lowers bust%

lowers volatility

makes the player look better than reality

Correct rule

Count a week as “played” if they had any opportunity / participation, not points.

Best Sleeper-only approach (WR/TE/RB/QB):

If any stat field exists for that week (targets, rec, rush_att, pass_att, etc.), it counts as played.

For WR/TE specifically: targets >= 0 is not enough (could be missing). Use:

targets OR rec OR rec_yd OR rush_att OR pass_att exists in the stat object.

Practical implementation:

If the player has a weekly stat object present for that week, count it as played.

If the stat object is missing entirely, that’s “no game log entry” (didn’t play / no data).

In short: include 0-point games whenever the player appeared.

2) Weekly Finish: make sure you rank only relevant players that week

Your approach is correct conceptually, but you must avoid ranking against dudes who didn’t play.

Correct ranking pool

For week W, position WR:

include only WRs with a “played” flag true (as defined above)

rank by weekly PPR points descending

This prevents “WR90” weeks from being diluted by 200 inactive WRs.

3) Thresholds: your Elite/Starter/Bust are good

For WR:

Elite = Top 5 ✅

Starter = Top 12 ✅

Bust = Outside Top 36 ✅

These are fantasy-realistic.

(For RB/QB/TE you can mirror later.)

4) Volatility: correct, but compute it on the same “played games” set

Std dev formula is good (sample std dev using n−1).
Just make sure it uses the same games used in PPG and the finish metrics.

5) Consistency score: replace CV * 1.5 (too harsh)

Your current formula:

CV = (stdev / mean) * 100

Score = 100 − CV*1.5 (clamped)

This will frequently slam good-but-swingy players to 0, which feels broken in UI.

Better: use a soft curve with floor/ceiling

Keep CV (it’s great), but map it smoothly.

Recommended StatChasers mapping:

Compute CV as a ratio (not percent): cv = stdev / mean

Then:

consistency = round(100 / (1 + (cv / 0.6)^2))


What it does:

cv = 0.3 → ~80–90 (very steady)

cv = 0.6 → ~50 (average)

cv = 1.0 → ~26 (boom/bust)

never instantly hits 0 unless cv is extreme

Labels (keep yours, slightly adjusted)

70+ = Very Consistent

45–69 = Average

<45 = Boom or Bust

This will feel “right” to users.

6) Naming: “Consistency = 0” is emotionally jarring

Even if mathematically “true,” a hard 0 looks like a bug.

With the improved curve, you’ll rarely hit 0, and users will trust it more.

7) Also add one sanity metric: “Goose Egg %”

Sleeper-friendly and very informative:

goose% = (# weeks with pts == 0 AND played) / games_played


That pairs perfectly with Bust%.

Updated Logic Summary (drop-in)
Games Played

Count a week as played if weekly stat object exists and indicates participation (any relevant stat field present). Include 0-point games.

PPG

ppg = total_pts / games_played

Weekly Finish

Rank only played players at that position for that week.

Elite/Starter/Bust

Same thresholds.

Volatility

Sample std dev across played weeks.

Consistency Score (recommended)
cv = stdev / ppg
consistency = round(100 / (1 + (cv / 0.6)^2))

If you want, here’s exactly what to tell Replit AI
Fix player overview metric logic:

1) Games played must NOT be filtered by pts_ppr > 0.
Count a game as played if the weekly stats object exists and indicates participation (any of targets/rec/rec_yd/rush_att/pass_att or similar fields exist). Include 0.0 point games.

2) Weekly finish calculations: when ranking all players for a given week+position, only include players who “played” that week (same participation rule). Rank by weekly PPR points.

3) Keep thresholds:
WR Elite <=5, Starter <=12, Bust >36.

4) Volatility: sample std dev of weekly PPR across played games.

5) Replace Consistency score formula with a smooth CV mapping:
cv = stdev / ppg
consistency = round(100 / (1 + (cv / 0.6)^2))
Labels: 70+ Very Consistent, 45–69 Average, <45 Boom/Bust.

6) Add Goose Egg %:
(# played weeks with pts==0) / games_played.
