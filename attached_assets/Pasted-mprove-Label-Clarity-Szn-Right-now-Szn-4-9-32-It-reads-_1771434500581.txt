mprove Label Clarity (“Szn”)

Right now:

Szn: 4.9 -32%

It reads slightly cramped.

Upgrade to:

Season Avg: 4.9
↓ -32%

Or:

4.9 (Season) ↓ 32%

Even better:

Season: 4.9 | -32%

Cleaner language increases perceived quality.

🔥 2️⃣ Improve Visual Hierarchy

Right now all cards have equal weight.

But they are not equal importance.

For WR:

Primary Usage:

Targets/G

Yards/G

Secondary Efficiency:

Catch %

Yards/Target

TD Rate

Context:

WR1 %

Make Targets/G slightly more emphasized (subtle thicker border or slightly bolder number).

That guides the eye properly.

🔥 3️⃣ Tighten TD Rate Presentation

Right now:

TD Rate
0.3
Szn: 0.3

That looks flat.

Instead show:

TDs/Game: 0.30
Season: 0.30 (0%)

Or:

TD Rate: 0.30
No change vs season

Make neutral deltas explicit instead of blank.

🔥 4️⃣ Add Small Visual Role Divider

Right now it’s just a grid.

Consider adding:

Top row label: Usage
Bottom row label: Efficiency

Very subtle small uppercase text above each row.

That gives structure.

🔥 5️⃣ Improve the Signal Line

Current:

“Signal: Usage-driven dip — target volume declining.”

That’s good.

Make it slightly more decisive and structured:

Signal: Usage-Driven Decline
Target volume down 32% vs season.

Two-line structured format feels more premium.

🔥 6️⃣ Optional Micro Upgrade: Add Trend Arrows Per Card

Right now only color shows direction.

Add tiny arrows:

↑ 8%
↓ 27%

Visual reinforcement improves scannability.

🔥 7️⃣ One Potential Upgrade (High Impact)

Right now this section is very similar to Section 2 (trend charts).

To avoid redundancy:

You could shift Section 3 to focus on:

Season vs Last 3 Snapshot (which you’re doing)
Instead of repeating “trend direction.”

That’s already what you’re doing — just tighten the labels to make that explicit.

Maybe title it:

Role Snapshot (Season vs Recent)

That clarifies its purpose.

🔥 8️⃣ Minor Spacing Tweak

Cards are slightly airy.

Reducing vertical padding by ~10% will make it feel tighter and more professional.

Premium dashboards feel compact.
