My Divi player pages are being treated as a BLOG POST with right sidebar:
<body class="... et_right_sidebar ..."> and the HTML shows <article class="type-post ... post-885 ...>.
This breaks the Theme Builder header/footer and layout.

Refactor the plugin to render inside a REAL WordPress Page context using a “container page” approach.

Requirements:

1) Create a plugin setting for a Container Page ID:
- Add under Tools -> StatChasers Players a dropdown of pages to select “Container Page”
- Option name: scpp_container_page_id
- Also include a button to auto-create pages:
  Parent page: "NFL" slug "nfl"
  Child page: "Players" slug "players"
  Save the Players page ID as the container page.

2) Routing:
- Keep player URL structure:
  /nfl/players/ (directory)
  /nfl/players/{slug}/ (player profile)
- Use rewrite rules to capture:
  sc_players_index = 1
  sc_player_slug = {slug}

3) Force WordPress query to the container PAGE:
On requests that match sc_players_index or sc_player_slug:
- In a hook like 'pre_get_posts' or 'parse_request':
  - Load the container page post by ID.
  - Set $wp_query flags so WP thinks this is that PAGE:
    $wp_query->is_page = true;
    $wp_query->is_singular = true;
    $wp_query->is_home = false;
    $wp_query->is_archive = false;
    $wp_query->is_404 = false;
  - Set queried object:
    $wp_query->queried_object = $container_post;
    $wp_query->queried_object_id = $container_post->ID;
  - Set the posts array:
    $wp_query->posts = array($container_post);
    $wp_query->post = $container_post;
    $wp_query->found_posts = 1;
    $wp_query->post_count = 1;
  - Set global $post and call setup_postdata($post)

This MUST prevent Divi from using et_right_sidebar / type-post.

4) Inject plugin output into the container page content:
- Add a 'the_content' filter:
  - If sc_players_index: replace content with the directory/search HTML.
  - If sc_player_slug: replace content with the player profile HTML.
- Keep all markup inside <div class="sc-players">...</div>
- Remove any direct template_redirect rendering that bypasses WP page context.

5) Divi layout:
- Ensure the body classes become a PAGE layout (no et_right_sidebar) and Theme Builder header/footer matches my real pages.

6) After changes:
- Tell me exactly which hooks you used and which files changed.
- Tell me to re-save permalinks and select the container page in settings.

Important:
Do NOT accidentally reuse a blog post as the context. The rendered article should be a PAGE, not type-post.
