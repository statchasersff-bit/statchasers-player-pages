The Right Way To Define Consistency

Instead of raw point thresholds…

Use Positional Tier Finishes

Define Weekly Tiers Like This:
QB

QB1 week = Top 12 finish

QB2 week = 13–24

QB3+ = 25+

RB

RB1 week = Top 12

RB2 week = 13–24

RB3+ = 25+

WR

WR1 week = Top 12

WR2 week = 13–24

WR3 week = 25–36

TE

TE1 week = Top 12

TE2 week = 13–24

🧠 Now Define Consistency Properly
Starter % (Best Name)

Starter % = % of Games Finishing in Top 12

Formula:

Starter% = (Top 12 Finishes / Games Played) × 100


This is clean, intuitive, and league-relevant.

For superflex you could tweak QB to Top 18 later.

🔥 Even Better: Tier Breakdown (This Is Premium)

Instead of just one number, show:

For a WR:

WR1 % | WR2 % | WR3+ %

Example:

WR1: 31%
WR2: 25%
WR3+: 44%

This tells a complete weekly profile.

🚀 Even More Premium (StatChasers Advantage)

Add:

Elite % (Top 5 Finish)
Starter % (Top 12)
Bust % (Outside Top 24 or 36)

Now you have:

Ceiling
Reliability
Risk

All in 3 numbers.

🧮 Why This Is Better Than 20+ %

Adjusts for scoring inflation

Adjusts across seasons

Adjusts across positions

Works even in weird scoring weeks

More fantasy-intelligent

This is exactly how high-level analysts think.

⚡ What I Recommend You Display

In the Summary Bar:

Games | PPG | Elite % | Starter % | Bust %

Definitions:

Elite %

Top 5 finish (QB/RB/WR)
Top 3 for TE (optional)

Starter %

Top 12 finish (all positions)

Bust %

QB: outside Top 18
RB/WR: outside Top 24
TE: outside Top 18

🧠 Example (Josh Allen)

Games: 16
Elite %: 31%
Starter %: 75%
Bust %: 6%

That’s incredibly powerful at a glance.

💻 What to Tell Replit AI

Paste this:

Add tier-based consistency metrics to the player Game Log summary.

Definitions:

Elite% = Top 5 weekly finish at position (Top 3 for TE optional)
Starter% = Top 12 weekly finish at position
Bust% =
  QB: finish > 18
  RB/WR: finish > 24
  TE: finish > 18

Use:
Metric% = (TierGames / GamesPlayed) * 100

GamesPlayed = weeks with stats (exclude bye/inactive).

Compute from FIN (weekly position rank).
