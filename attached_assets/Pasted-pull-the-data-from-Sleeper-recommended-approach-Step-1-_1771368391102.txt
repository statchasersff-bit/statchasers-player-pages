pull the data from Sleeper (recommended approach)
Step 1 — Get the player’s Sleeper player_id

From your existing player store (you already have this if you’re using Sleeper player JSON).

Step 2 — Pull weekly stats by season/week (not “game logs”)

Sleeper exposes weekly stat payloads and/or player-season stats endpoints (undocumented). Libraries that wrap Sleeper explicitly reference endpoints like “player season stats” and “projections”.

In practice, you’ll do one of these patterns:

Pattern A (best for tables): pull stats for the week, then extract the player

You fetch the stats payload for a given season + week

Then pick out stats[player_id]

This scales well because you can ingest once per week and update all players.

Pattern B (best for 1 player quick fetch): player season stats grouped by week

You call a player-season stats endpoint and ask for weekly grouping (commonly referenced in the wild)

I’m intentionally not hardcoding exact URLs here because Sleeper has multiple variants floating around (api.sleeper.app vs api.sleeper.com) and the “stats” endpoints aren’t in the official docs. The safest implementation is: use the endpoints your current repo already uses for stats/projections and extend that ingestion to include receiving fields.

What fields you need for your columns

For WR/TE/RB receiving columns, you need these stat keys from Sleeper’s weekly stats object:

Targets → often rec_tgt (sometimes targets)

REC → rec

REC YDS → rec_yd

REC TDS → rec_td

Then compute POINTS yourself (recommended) using your site’s scoring (ex: PPR):

points = rec * 1 + rec_yd * 0.1 + rec_td * 6
(+ fumbles, 2PT, rush, etc if you want full accuracy)

Why compute yourself? Because “fantasy points” can differ by league scoring — even Sleeper users run into this and end up calculating from stats.

How to handle “years of history” without killing performance
✅ The right architecture

Ingest → Store → Serve

Ingest job (cron / scheduled)

For each season you support (ex: last 3–5 years)

For each week (1–18 + playoffs if desired)

Fetch weekly stats once

Upsert into your game_logs table (or player_week_stats)

Player page API

GET /api/players/:slug/gamelog?season=YYYY

Query your DB: WHERE player_id=? AND season=? ORDER BY week

Return rows already shaped for your table

UI

Season dropdown

Table renders instantly

No Sleeper calls on page load

This is how you make 300 player pages fast + reliable.
